# Study Break – January 2026

## Status
Due to temporary limitations, I was unable to continue the learning schedule for a short period.

## Reflection
- Linux is still a new environment for me
- I realized the importance of moving at a steady pace rather than rushing

## Next Steps
- Resume Linux practice with focus on fundamentals
- Continue with Week 2 plan
